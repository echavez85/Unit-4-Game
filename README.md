# Unit-4-Game

Golden Girls Collector is a game where players gain points by clicking on one of the four Golden Girls (Dorothy, Rose, Blanche, and Sophia). At the beginning of each game, each of the Golden Girls is assigned a random number between 1 and 12. The game adds up the points for each click, with the ultimate goal being to reach the Random Number that was generated at the beginning of the game without going over it.

Once the game is won or lost, a new Random Number is generated and each of the Golden Girls are assigned a new value.
