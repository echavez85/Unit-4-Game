// Function to select a random number between 5 and 75 and place in #randomNumber.


// Function to count wins vs. losses.

// Function will assign a random number between 1 and 9 to each of the Golden Girls. This number will change every "new game". This will probably be like the numbers on a calculator, an addition symbol, and equal sign all combined so that numbers can add up.

// This will add up/display the total value of the Golden Girls in the same way the result area did on the calculator.

// If result above is higher than random number generated above, loss will increase. If it's lower, nothing done. If it's equal, wins will increase.
